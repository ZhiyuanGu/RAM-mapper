2. Steps to build and run the RAM mapper in Visual Studio(I am using Visual Studio Community 2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Build-->Build Solution	
	
2) Debug-->Start Debugging
	RAM mapper starts running.
	
3) When you are asked to enter architecture number:
	Enter 1 performs mapping for Stratix IV-like architecture.	
	Enter 4 performs mapping for architecture of my own choice to map the benchmark circuits better.
	Enter 5 performs mapping for architecture with MTJ RAMs and also of my own choice to map the benchmark circuits better.
	Enter 2 performs mapping test for architecture with no LUTRAM and only one type of block RAM with varying size.
	Enter 3 performs mapping test for architecture with 50% of logic blocks supporting LUTRAM and only one type of block RAM with varying size.	
	
4) Checker is automatically called and detailed information is shown in the terminal.
	(Note that the checker result for architecture 5 is different from what is calculated by the mapper because MTJ RAM was not specified to the checker)


Thank you for reading!
